# 8051 Microcontroller
## Intro
I will be using this repository to learn how to program a 8051 microcontroller using the book "The 8051 Microcontroller and Embedded Systems" as a guideline to do so. Just like in the book there is a section using Assembly and a section using C to program the microcontroller. Although my focus will be on using C to program the 8051. I'm using a laptop with Linux to program the 8051 microcontroller. 

## Hardware
I'm using a development board STC89C52 bought on Amazon for learning.
